## Learning Methods
In the study module, up-to-date methods and materials are utilized in the teaching of cross-platform mobile programming. During the study module, students will familiarize themselves with different cross-platform mobile programming techniques and methods.

At the beginning of the study module, the student chooses the method of completion:
- A project-based approach focusing on a specific cross-platform technology to deepen skills with the chosen technique.
- Alternatively, completing smaller exercises throughout the study module that cover multiple different cross-platform mobile programming techniques.

---

## Grading

### **Learning Diary**
- General assessment criteria is applied to learning diary regardless of the chosen path.
- **Study Path 1**: Learning diary assessed based on quality, amount of work, and completion of assignments.
- **Study Path 2**: Learning diary assessed based on the quality and amount of work.

### **Extras**
- Smaller tasks to increase your grade by up to 30 points.

**Points to Grade:**
- 40 points ➔ Grade 1
- 50 points ➔ Grade 2
- 60 points ➔ Grade 3
- 70 points ➔ Grade 4
- 80 points ➔ Grade 5

> Example: With 79.5 points, the grade is **4**.

## Study Paths
<br/>

### **1. Lecture sets**
- Complete the course by following lectures and completing assignments that are given throughout the course, update learning diary accordingly. Explore or/and implement features of your own to get better grade.

<br/>


### **2. Independent Study**
- Choose a cross-platform mobile application technology/framework.
- Study and explore the chosen technology
- Develop an application that meets given requirements for path 2 completion.

> **Main Goal:** Develop a mobile application that is meaningful to you. Examples include tools, games, or problem-solving applications.

---


## First task

_Answer how you currently understand the terms_

#### 1. What is cross-platform development?

#### 2. What cross-platform technologies do you know currently? 

#### 3. How would you describe your knowledge of Web technologies?

#### 5. How would you describe your knowledge of object-oriented languages?

# Lecture 2, Flutter & React Native 


<br/>

### Hands-on experience for setting up popular cross-platform development technologies


Requirements:

> Install latest versions 

- Android Studio, https://developer.android.com/studio
- Git, https://git-scm.com/
- NodeJs, https://nodejs.org/en
- VSCode (recommended), https://code.visualstudio.com/

React Native: https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment

Flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

-- _React Native and Flutter setup will be done together on lecture_

---

## Assignment of the lecture

### Setup both, Flutter and React Native development environments

**Using starter applications of each technology:**

1. Modify the code to create two simple buttons to the view

2. Apply state modifiers so that one button increments and other button decrements displayed value

3. Add comparison to learning diary (or blog) of the state management approaches of Flutter and React Native.

4. Search for more information about the differences between React Native and Flutter, add summary of the differences to learning diary.

--- 

## Dart, programming language of the Flutter

---

# Lecture 3, Dart - Programming language of The chosen technology

*See the links to videos on Moodle!*

Dart documentation: https://dart.dev/docs
Package repository for Dart & Flutter libraries: https://pub.dev/

--- 

# Lecture 4, First Flutter Application

1. Start with working on Google's codelab: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab

We are going to use that code created in codelab as a base for our application: *Movie Match (or whatever you would like to call it!)*

Example of a real-world flutter application (Proof of Consept), made in a DWELL project: https://github.com/MatiasHiltunen/dwellapp-example

---

#### The App

The app we are building is going to have following features:

1. It loads a movie list from some movie api alongside the cover images for the movies, such as: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started
2. Backend service (example [here](https://github.com/MatiasHiltunen/dart_movies_server)) that we can connect to get access to realtime API which allows us to register new account, singin with the account and then connect with a friend
   - Second phone/emulator can be used with testing/experimenting with features
4. Idea is to have an application that allows choosing a movie with a friend that you both would like to watch, and when first "match" happens, that shows on both devices as a "pop-up" that you have now a movie that you both would like to watch!
